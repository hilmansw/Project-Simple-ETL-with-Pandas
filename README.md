# Project Simple-ETL with Pandas

This project is a project provided by DQLab that I managed to work on. In this project, a dataset of hackathon registrants organized by DQLab named DQThon is presented which consists of about 5000 rows of data in Comma-separated values (CSV) format.

Thus, the data will be transformed based on:
1. Postcode
2. City
3. Github
4. Mobile Number
5. Team Name
6. Email
7. Date of Birth, and
8. Competition Registration Date
